# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2

### Day 1: May 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Added password to the user model since I figured I'd need it later on when I add authentication. Filled in the rest of the routes (POST, PATCH, DELETE). I started checking that the views actually render properly and realized I had to move the /new route before /:username and /:username/edit, or else "new" would be considered the username. Also changed all the :id's to :username because I was confusing id with the ObjectId that Mongoose assigns each user. Passed the usernames to the view files and tweaked the view files accordingly.

**Thoughts:** It's difficult to remember the various Mongoose methods available and what parameters they take. I need to figure out how to handle errors properly, and learn how .then() works.
